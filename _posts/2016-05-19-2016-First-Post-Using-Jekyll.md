This is a test of the [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com) and it seems to be all working.  It will allow me to write pages with markdown, and be a alot easier than managing a static website template myself.  It is considered a "static site generator",  and is dependent on the scripting language Ruby to work.

The biggest benefit for Jekyll is that Github Pages (the host of this site) uses it and there is no custom configuration required to make use of it.  This is my first time using Jekyll, and I am impressed.  It uses a very similar templating system to what I've seen in Django a server side Python module/library.  Basicall Jekyll requires you write a template HTML page and include a few special strings that tells Jekyll where to convert and fill in content when you write a markdown file.  

This is all kept straight according a specific file system that must be used for Jekyll to work.  Again this file structure seems very similar to what I've seen for Django.  

Overall, I'm impressed with how easy its been to get this simple site up and how easy it is to add content to it using markdown.
