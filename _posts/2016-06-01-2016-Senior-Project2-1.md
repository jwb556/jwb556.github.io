# Revisiting the Piano Note Recognition Device

My senior project experience was broken up into two separate projects.  The second of these projects was a audio based piano note recognizer.
Overtime, I've realized there were so many ways I could have made that project better.  I had two other team members, one who handled management and documentation, the other who handled programming.  At semester end our team's project worked as hoped and was voted best EE project for that semester.

In order to further learn the Kicad EDA system I placed (without routing) a PCB and modeled it in 3D.  The objective to this mini project was to keep in mind the time limitations I had during that semester, and come up with the quick and feasible ways I could have made that project better.

The project was given the following requirements:

* Identify a key played 1 octave above and below middle C on a piano
* Display the key pressed on an LCD screen
* Be battery powered
* Have a mode that quizes the user to play a certain note, then reports if the not played was correct.

I was in charge of hardware design on the project, so I did all the BOM selection, and PCB layout.  I used large and bulky but safe picks for things like th LCD, battery, and microcontroller.  While the project did work, and didn't require too many excessively late nights to complete the product was more of a bullet proof solution rather than an elegant one.

Some of my hardware picks included:

* large NewHaven Display parallel interface LCD with already mounted PCB
* (1) 5 Ni-Mh battery pack (large) (7.4V nominal)
* 8b Atmel microcontroller run at 16MHz
* all components on PCB were TH technology
* project enclosure was an off the shelf enclosure from Digikey

I decided for the project enclosure to try to build something in FreeCad that could be printed, as a good exercise of the tool and because if the project were redone today 3D printers are now easily available at my university. 

The schematic that I came up with can be seen below.  Everything on the bulleted list above changed.

First, the processor changed to one of Microchip's dsPic series microcontrollers.  These devices are meant for doing digital signal processing.  My initial design was quite slow in processing the waveform and extracting its dominant frquency.  There were two reasons for this:


* Our firmware implemented the DFT, not an FFT
* Our processor was not picked to do floating point, digital signal processing type operations.


For time and ease of the project we chose to use the DFT because there were no constraints on how long our unit took to identify a note.  The second bullet point was not intentional and was due to a lack of understanding of what products were available.  Something like the dsPic series would work well for this application if were done over and would offer noticeable different in time to solution for our piano note recognizer.

When a power budget was done for our project it was found our product could be on and running for 4-5 days straight.  This was unnecessary, and made the whole product much bigger than it needed to be.  In this iteration the target battery would be a 9V battery.

For ease of development I would change to an LCD with I2C interface rather than a parallel bus, which is reflected in the schematic.  Although unimportant, I kept the brand of the display the same (New Haven Displays). 

For elegance and for signal integrity on the PCB, this attempt at the project uses entirely surface mount technology.  Not only does this help with bypassing the microcontroller better, but keeps the PCB smaller and the overall device smaller as well.

Kicad was not as popular when I was in school, so i used the student version of EagleCad which lacked an easy way to model 3D components.  Below is the placed (not routed) PCB for this thought experiment.
