# Revisiting the Piano Note Recognition Device (Part 2) 

During senior project I was also in charge of packaging our project into an enclosure to make it look finished.  

I ended up choosing an off the shelf enclosure that we then cut holes in.  We were careful and this did look ok, but the overall product looked very much like a hobbyist project.  From memory I believe that the product below (from Digikey) is the original box I chose)

This iteration I tried my hand at FreeCad to design an enclosure for the very standard PCB shape I made in Kicad.  I used the original design of the original enclosure for inspiration, but tried to make this enclosure much smaller and tailored to this PCB.  The following are some picture of this enclosure.

Unfortunately getting a .step file of the pcb from KiCad is not a simple task, so i had to make my own (less nice looking) model of it in FreeCard.

The holes on the top enclosure are designed to be tapped for a 4-40 hole and the holes on the bottom enclosure are clearance drilled, so the screw only thread engages with the top part of the enclosure.  

Lastly, a good enclosure accounts for that fact that the two surfaces mating may not engage perfectly.  This is why companies include lips on their enclosures.  These lips not only help for aligning to two halves of the enclosure, but also for filling the gap between the two halves if they don't engage close enough.  This lip can be seen on most standard products and is something I included in this design as well.
