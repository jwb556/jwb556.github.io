# Revisiting the Piano Note Recognition Device (Part 3) 

This is the 3rd and final part of the revisiting the piano note recognizer project.  In this post I hope to talk about how I would manufacture this small prototype project, including:

* PCB fabrication
* PCB assembly
* Enclosure Manufacturing

## PCB fabriation

If I were to refabricate this board, without the ability to leverage a student discount, I would most likely end up using Osh Park.  They are small pcb manufacture that specializes in small batches of PCBs for prototyping.  My current PCB shape has the dimensions of 2.5" x 3".  This comes out to 7.5in^2.  [Osh Park](http://www.oshpark.com) charges $10/in^2for a standard four layer board and delivers 3 copies of your board for this price.  This would come out to $75 plus shipping and tax and would be ready is about 2 weeks.

## PCB assembly

All of the components chosen for this PCB could be assembled by hand without too much issue.  My university posses soldering irons and microscopes for doing smd soldering.  If I needed to have the SMD components on the board populated there is relatively new small business named [Small Batch Assembly](www.smallbatchassembly.com), which does low quantity SMD only assembly. Quoting for my board which would need 54 placements and have 26 unique parts, would require $193 per board to accomplish at a quantity of 3.

## Housing Manufacturing

Even if my univeristy didn't have a 3D printer, my group could have gotten the enclosure printed for $35, $15 for the top and $20 for the bottom.  The website I used to find this price was [PrintAThing](http://www.printathing.com)
